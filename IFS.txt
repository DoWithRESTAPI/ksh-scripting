IFS (Internal Field Separator):
==============================

    The shell uses the value stored in IFS, which is the space, tab, and newline characters by default, to delimit words for the read and
    set commands, when parsing output from command substitution, and when performing variable substitution.
    


Ex:
  line=learn:unix:at:livefire:labs
  for i in $line
  do
    echo $i
  done
Then the outpt is:
          learn:unix:at:livefire:labs
$ OIFS=$IFS
$ IFS=:
  for i in $line
  do
    echo $i
  done

Then the output is:
  learn
  unix
  at
  livefire
  labs

  Note: if you want to consider any other than default IFS(SPACE,TAB AND NEWLINE) as IFS then you have to overwrite or append the IFS
